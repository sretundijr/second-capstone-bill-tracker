To run locally npm run serve on local host 8080

There are currently three end points:
  /index (landing page)
  /house-stats
  /create-house

The create house page is used to collect both roommate and expense data. After all data has been
entered the user can then submit and the app will divide expenses to the entered roommates.

House stats shows all of the expenses entered and the division of bills amongst roommates.

Both pages have a desktop rendering and a mobile friendly rendering for better UX.

The app is currently in demo mode only.
