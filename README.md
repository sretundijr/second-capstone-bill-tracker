The following screen is used to create a household.  It includes three forms, the first for entering the household name.  The second is used to enter a roommate and the third is for entering an expense.  User data is validated for each submission.  In order to submit the household, there is a requirement of atleast one roommate and one expense.  Once this requirement is met a submit button renders to the UI.
